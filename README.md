## Suggested Timeline

| Week | Goals |
|------|-------|
| 1    | Project setup, authentication, Docker |
| 2    | MongoDB modeling + Location API |
| 3    | Reservation API + Start frontend |
| 4    | Blazor UI + GitHub Actions pipeline |
| 5    | Final testing + demo ðŸŽ‰ |

## Next Steps

1. Create the GitHub repo
2. Initialize the solution and projects
3. Write the initial architecture (backend, frontend, docker)
4. Build iteratively based on the roadmap
